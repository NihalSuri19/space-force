# Space-Force
The game is a take on a 2-D Space Shooter. There is the main player which has the ability of 360 degree shooting using vectors.
   There are three different kind of enemies of varying sizes and speeds. The bigger enemies need more bullets for them to get destoyed. The player 
   needs to escape the enemies. Once all the health get's over the player get's destroyed but if the player scores 300 points before 
   the health reaches 0 the player wins!
   
   Game controls -
 PRESS WSAD to move the player. 
 PRESS the left key on the mouse to shoot in any direction.
 PRESS R to unlock GODMODE, where you can shoot unlimited bullets in any direction, 
 but GODMODE can only be used when the player is stationary not otherwise.
